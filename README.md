# Python-Introduction-bitwise-operation

## Tasks

### Task 1: 
Calculate the highest possible number with 4 bits?

Your result should look like this:

> 15
> 0b1111

### Task 2: 
Check if the following numbers are even or odd with the bitwise and operator.

- Print out the given numbers (num1 to num6) in decimal and binary format.
- print 0 if the number is even and 1 if the number is odd

> Hint: 
> - use the *bitwise and*
> - use 1 as the second operand

Your result should look like this:

>1 0b1 1
>2 0b10 0
>3 0b11 1
>4 0b100 0
>5 0b101 1
>6 0b110 0

### Task 3: 
- Assign to the variable ```c``` the result of the XOR operation of a and b.   
- Then use the XOR operation of c and ___ to get back the value of a. Assign the result to d.

Your result should look like this:

>0b1 ^  0b10  =  0b11
>0b11 ^ 0b10  =  0b1

### Task 4: 
Swap the values of a and b by using the XOR operator.

Your result should look like this:

>before swap: a = 1 , b = 2
>after swap: a = 2 , b = 1

### Task 5: 
- Left shift a number by certain number of bits.

Your result should look like this:

>2
>4
>8
>16
>
>0b10
>0b100
>0b1000
>0b10000

- Then calculate the following results without using the left shift operator:

>2
>4
>8
>16
>

### Task 6: 

Right shift the number 28 by 2 bits.

Your result should be:

> 7
